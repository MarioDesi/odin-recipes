        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 thick slices Italian bread</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped fresh spinach</li>
            <li>½ cup giardiniera, drained</li>
            <li>2 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices provolone cheese</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix butter and garlic in a small bowl until well combined. Spread 1/2 of the butter onto one side of each slice of bread; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-heat; stir spinach and giardiniera. Saute until spinach is wilted and mixture is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a bowl and wipe out the skillet</li>
            <li>Place 1 slice of bread, buttered-side down, into one side of teh warm skillet. Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil in the other side of the skillet. Place mozzarella slices in teh skillet and cook until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Place mozzarella slices on top of the bread in the skillet. Repeat with the provolone, Asiago, and Fontina slices.</li>
            <li>Add spinach mixture and tomato slices to the skillet, adding more oil if necessary, and cook intil warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Place spinach mixture on top of the cheese, followed by the tomatoes and teh remaining slice of bread, buttered-side up. Flip the sand and cook until browned and cheese has melted, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
